# Document-Clustering-on-Ethical-Governance-of-Artificial-Intelligence-using-Machine-Learning

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) requires proper governance that takes ethical principles into account to ensure that the development and use of technology are responsible for society and users. Publications related to AI ethics have therefore received a great deal of attention. Research in this area has increased continuously from 2019 to 2023, resulting in a large volume of data without proper categorization. As a result, searching for information is more difficult. Machine learning was therefore applied to cluster and categorize academic papers related to AI ethics. Upon analyzing data from a total of 6,489 abstracts, it was found that, compared to AI governance frameworks developed by various organizations from 2019 to 2023, the top three principles were fairness, effectiveness, and safety. The most suitable algorithm for clustering is K-means, which was applied with the fastText technique for text embedding. The Silhouette Coefficient was 0.285 and the Davies-Bouldin Index was 0.886.
